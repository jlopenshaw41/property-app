# Property website

A luxury property sales website, built using the latest React technologies. 

Users can view properties for sale, sort, search and filter property results and send an email enquiry to the vendor. Users can also login (using Facebook login API) and save properties to favourites.

As an additional feature, vendors can also add new properties by submitting the 'Add property' form. In the backend, properties are stored in a MongoDB database via an Express API. HTTP requests are made from the frontend using axios. Tested using Jest & React Testing Library, following Test-Driven Development methodology.

I've written a blog post documenting how I built this project - [check it out here](https://jlopenshaw.hashnode.dev/bootcamp-journal-react-property-website-project).
